## Wailua Website
### Webdesign, Programming, SEO, Photography, Video-Editing

I made a relaunch for the website of the embroidery based in Rüsselsheim, Germany. Instead of using a complete dark color scheme like the old website I tried to make the new website brighter. In addition, more of the 'Hawaiian feeling' should be transmitted, because the company name comes from a waterfall on Hawaii. I solved this with a video of the waterfall played on the startpage and floating palm leaves on the sides of the website. My services also included photography, video production & capturing the company building with a drone.
